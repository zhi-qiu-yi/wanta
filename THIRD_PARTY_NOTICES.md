# Third-Party Notices

Wanta incorporates and redistributes open-source components. The entries below document the key
runtime components that Wanta starts or places directly in a packaged application's resources.
They do not replace the license files shipped inside npm dependencies. A complete generated report
for all transitive build and runtime dependencies remains part of release preparation.

## OpenCode

Wanta uses [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) as its local Agent engine:

- `opencode-ai@1.18.21` — packaged executable and local `opencode serve` sidecar;
- `@opencode-ai/sdk@1.18.21` — HTTP/SSE client used by the Electron main process;
- `@opencode-ai/plugin@1.18.21` — tool API bundled into Wanta's Agent tool runtime.

License: MIT. Copyright (c) 2025 opencode.

Wanta is not a fork of OpenCode. It embeds the pinned OpenCode runtime and builds desktop lifecycle,
security isolation, model configuration, permissions, sessions, Connector tools, and artifact UI
around it.

## Claude Agent ACP Bridge

Wanta packages `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.70.0` as the sole Claude Code transport.
The bridge exposes the official Claude Agent SDK over ACP while continuing to launch the user's
own Claude Code executable and native configuration.

is included in this repository's [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file.

## oo CLI and Bundled Skills

Wanta downloads and packages `@oomol-lab/oo-cli@1.7.12` platform binaries from the public npm
registry. The default package also contains four Skills exported by that distribution:

- `oo`;
- `oo-find-skills`;
- `oo-create-skill`;
- `oo-publish-skill`.

Source: [oomol-lab/oo-cli](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oo-cli). License: MIT.

The CLI and Skills are included by default so official OOMOL Connector and endpoint-compatible,
self-hosted OpenConnector deployments can use the same invocation path. Local BYOK mode does not
register Connector tools or inject the oo runtime environment.

## WeCom CLI and Skills

Wanta packages the official `@wecom/cli@1.1.0` platform binary and the matching `wecomcli-*`
Skills from source commit `cd0480e0e4013c99cc9e7bb4a3247ec949a052d8` for the local WeCom Direct
provider.

## DingTalk Workspace CLI and Skills

Wanta packages the official DingTalk Workspace CLI (`dws`) version 1.0.59 and the matching stable
mono Skill from the same release for the local DingTalk Direct provider.

Source: [DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli](https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli).
License: Apache License 2.0; the complete license text is included in this repository's
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file. Copyright 2026 Alibaba Group.

The upstream platform archives include the following `NOTICE`, reproduced here as required:

```text
DingTalk Workspace CLI (dws)
Copyright 2026 Alibaba Group

This product includes software developed at
DingTalk (https://www.dingtalk.com/).
```

The CLI keeps account tokens encrypted through its platform credential backend. Wanta supplies
private configuration and ciphertext directories and exposes only redacted account and connection
state to the renderer.

## MIT License Text

The following text applies to the OpenCode, oo CLI, and WeCom CLI entries above:

## OOMOL-Maintained Public Packages

Wanta uses the publicly downloadable `@oomol/connection@0.2.28` and
`@oomol/connection-electron-adapter@0.2.12` packages for typed Electron IPC. They are maintained by
OOMOL and their published tarballs include source code. Their current package versions do not yet
declare license metadata or include a license file. Public npm availability permits anonymous
installation but does not by itself grant redistribution rights. Before an official distributable
Wanta release, OOMOL must either publish package versions with explicit license terms or record
written redistribution permission for these exact versions. Until then, this is a release-readiness
blocker for redistributed binaries, not an installation or source-build blocker.

## Other Dependencies and Assets

The repository also depends on Electron, React, Univer, wiki-graph, Streamdown, Iconify data, fonts,
and other direct and transitive packages under their respective licenses. Product names, service
logos, and trademarks are not licensed merely because an open-source package contains a reference
or icon. See [TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md).
